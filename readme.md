#Flexbox mixins

This are useful Sass mixins to handle different browsers resp. their rendering engines.
This mixins are more or less copied from the Mozilla Developer Network.

### If possible use Sass instead of less
I recommend you to use the Sass mixins instead of less because they have better conditionals to handle different input parameters.
Therefore can be some bugs in the less file. I'm gonna fix them as soon as possible.
